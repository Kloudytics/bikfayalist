# Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in BikfayaList for production deployment.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Registration**: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- **Listing Creation**: 10 listings per hour per user
- **Admin Actions**: 50 actions per 15 minutes for listing management
- **Admin Messages**: 100 actions per 15 minutes for message management
- **Admin Queries**: 200 queries per 15 minutes for data retrieval

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- Maximum length limits on all text fields

### 3. Authentication Security
- JWT-based sessions with 24-hour expiration
- Session updates every hour
- Forced re-authentication after 7 days
- Secure cookie configuration for production
- Password hashing using bcryptjs

### 4. Security Headers
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - HTTPS enforcement
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

### 5. CORS Configuration
- Configurable allowed origins via environment variables
- Credential support for authenticated requests
- Proper preflight handling

### 6. Admin Panel Security
- Role-based access control (ADMIN role required)
- Enhanced rate limiting for admin actions
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- Additional security headers for admin routes

### 7. Audit Logging
- All admin actions are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Action type
  - Resource affected
  - Admin user ID
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Severity level

### 8. Attack Prevention
- User agent filtering to block common attack tools
- Input length validation
- Parameter validation and sanitization

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secure-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"

# Security
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
ENABLE_SECURITY_HEADERS="true"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege**: Users only have necessary permissions
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **Secure Defaults**: Secure configurations by default
5. **Audit Trails**: All sensitive actions are logged
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
7. **HTTPS Only**: All cookies and sessions are secure

## Monitoring & Alerting

The application logs security events including:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Admin actions
- Suspicious user agents

## Deployment Security

### Netlify Configuration
- Security headers configured in `netlify.toml`
- Cache control for static assets
- HTTPS redirects
- Function bundling optimizations

### Database Security
- Uses Neon PostgreSQL with SSL required
- Connection string includes SSL mode and channel binding
- No SQL queries are constructed from user input

## Security Maintenance

1. Regular dependency audits: `npm run security:audit`
2. Type checking: `npm run type-check`
3. Regular security reviews of code changes
4. Environment variable rotation
5. Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity

## Incident Response

In case of security incidents:
1. Check audit logs for affected resources
2. Review rate limiting logs for attack patterns
3. Rotate affected credentials
4. Update security measures as needed
