## 📋 Netlify Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Configure these in Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_SFlj8pA7mvOw@ep-nameless-hat-a2mxdfem-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"

# NextAuth (Required) - Generate new secure values
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate_with_openssl_rand_base64_32"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.netlify.app"

# Security (Required)
NODE_ENV="production"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-domain.netlify.app"

# Demo Access (Optional - for beta testing)
DEMO_PASSWORD="B@troun007"

# Optional Services
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=""
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=""
